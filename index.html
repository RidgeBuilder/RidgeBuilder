  <p id="paper-subtitle">Interactive Authoring of Expressive Ridgeline Plots</p>
  <p id="abstract">
    Ridgeline plots are frequently used to visualize the evolution or distributions of multiple series using a pile of
    overlapping line, area, or bar charts, highlighting the peak patterns among these series. While the existing
    studies have mainly seen ridgeline plots as a type of small multiple visualization, the signature ridge-like
    patterns in these plots have increasingly attracted graphic designers to create appealing data visualizations
    based on customized ridgeline plots. However, many authoring tools only support creating basic ridgeline plots and
    overlook the diverse layouts and styles of these plots. In this paper, we present a comprehensive design space of
    ridgeline plots by surveying the usages of such plots, specifically focusing on delineating their diverse layouts
    and expressive styles. Based on this design space, we introduce RidgeBuilder, an intuitive tool that facilitates
    the fast authoring of expressive ridgeline plots with intuitive interactions and user-friendly recommendations. In
    particular, we summarize three goals for refining the layout of ridgeline plots and propose an optimization method
    that automatically generates an optimal order of the series in the plots. The effectiveness of RidgeBuilder is
    evaluated with a replication study where the participants were asked to recreate the existing complex ridgeline
    plots, and both qualitative and quantitative results indicate good usability and usefulness. We also evaluate the
    efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed layout optimization algorithm with anonymized questionnaires.
    Furthermore, the expressiveness of RidgeBuilder are demonstrated with a gallery of ridgeline plots created by our
    tool.

        This cyclic ridgeline plot highlights two peaks, one at 6:30.A.M.-8:30.A.M., which is the time
        period when residents go to work, and the other at 16:00.P.M.-19:00.P.M., which is the time period when
        residents go back to home.
